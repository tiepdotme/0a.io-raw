<b>PROLOGUE </b>
</p>
<p>Among the things I managed to teach myself after dropping out of school at the age of 16 was calculus. Before I knew what calculus is, merely hearing its name gave me the impression that it is one of the most complicated things in maths, and that I could not possibly learn it by looking into the freely-available resources online. <br> <br> I was wrong. <br> <br> It turned out that back then I had a rather naive view of what mathematics is about. Understanding calculus is not hard at all. It is simply a matter of whether you have stumbled upon the right resources to learn it. If you have difficulty understanding it, you are probably learning it the wrong way.<br> <br> I am nowhere near being an “expert” in calculus (or anything like that). I don’t really apply calculus to solve problems on a daily basis. To put it bluntly I am just a kid who writes about things he knew by heart so it may be used to help with those who are having a hard time learning it.<br> <br> Archy,<br> Oct 2014<br></p>

<div class="containing-images-of-max-80precent-width">
<p>Calculus is just a fanciful name for the study of change in maths. Calculus in general refers to the branch of maths that was made famous by Newton in the 17th century. Don’t confuse it with <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus">propositional calculus</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385375557/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385375557&linkCode=as2&tag=0aarhe-20&linkId=G75NU4TLDFAYKFK2">unicorns</a>, which are completely different things.</p>
<p>To understand calculus, one needs to be able to visualize the concepts of <u class="go_click">function</u>, <u class="go_click">limit</u>, <u class="go_click">differentiation</u>, and <u class="go_click">integration</u>.</p>

<h3 class="_index to_function">
1. What is a function?
</h3>
<p>A <u>function</u> can be seen as a machine that takes in value and gives you back another value. It is what we use in maths to map numbers (input) to other numbers (output).</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/f_machine.png">
</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ f(input) = output \]</span></p>
<p>A function is normally defined by an equation like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x) = x+10\]</span></p>
<p>Now if you put 2 into this function you will get 12 in return.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(2) = 12\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The set of numbers that you can put into a function is known as the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function">domain</a> of the function. If you’d like to have a more in-depth understanding of function (e.g. its formal definition), check out <a href="http://0a.io/0a-explains-set-theory-and-axiomatic-systems-with-pics-and-gifs">my article on set theory</a>. (You will probably love it!)</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
<h3 class="_index to_limit">
2. What is a limit?
</h3>
<p>A <u>limit</u> is the number you are “expected” to get from a function (or algebraic expression) when it takes in a certain input. By “expected” it is referring to the expectation of the output when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> “approaches” a certain value.</p>
<p>Here is an example where the limit (the expected output) is the same as the actual output.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lim_{x\rightarrow 2}\frac{5^x}{25} = 1\]</span></p>
<p>The limit above is often read as “the limit of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5^x}{25}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> approaches 2 is 1”. You can visualize “<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> approaches 2” as a dot moving along the graph towards where <span class="math inline">\(x = 2\)</span> (and, as you can see, <span class="math inline">\(y = 1\)</span>).</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/limit.gif">
</p>
<p>Now take this function for example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x) = \frac{(x^2-3x)^2}{x-3}\]</span></p>
<p>Division by 0 is undefined. We would get <span class="math inline">\(undefined\)</span> when we put 3 into the function.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(3) = \frac{(3^2-3 \cdot 3)^2}{3-3} = undefined \]</span></p>
<p>This is also why there is a hole in the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/hole.png">
</p>
<p>But looking at the graph, we can see that 0 is the expected value when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> approaches 3.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lim_{x\rightarrow 3}f(x) = 0 \]</span></p>
<p>To compute the limit when the actual output is undefined, in normal case we simply need to simplify the algebraic expression to avoid division by 0. And then put the value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is approaching into the function as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{(x^2-3x)^2}{x-3} = \frac{x^4-6x^3+9x^2}{x-3} = \frac{x^2(x-3)^2}{x-3} = x^2(x-3)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lim_{x\rightarrow 3}\frac{(x^2-3x)^2}{x-3} = \lim_{x\rightarrow 3} x^2(x-3) = 3^2(3-3) = 0\]</span></p>

<h3 class="_index to_differentiation">
3. What is differentiation?
</h3>
<p>Differentiation is a fanciful name for the process of obtaining a <u>derivative</u>. And a derivative is a function that gives you the “slope” (or rate of change) of another function at a certain point.</p>
<p>Basically, differentiation can be seen as a machine that takes in a function and gives you back another function.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/d_machine.png">
</p>
<p>We all know that the slope of a linear equation/function has a constant value. It has the same rate of change at every point on the line. So the graph of a linear equation/function is indeed a straight line.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/linear.png">
</p>
<p>For every value of 1 added to the input, a value of the slope (in this case, 4) would be added to the output.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/linear2.png">
</p>
<p>The change between input and output is always in the ratio of 1 to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the value for the slope. Adding 0.1 to the input will trigger a change of <span class="math inline">\(+0.1m\)</span> in the output, etc.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}f(5)&amp;=8 \\\\f(6) &amp;= f(5) + 1 \times 4 = 12 \\\\f(5.1) &amp;= f(5)+0.1\times 4 = 8.4 \\\\f(5.02) &amp;= f(5)+0.02 \times 4 = 8.08 \end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>But this is only true for linear function. For functions that are not linear, every point doesn’t have a constant rate of change. Take a look at the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=2^x\)</span>.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/nonlinear.png">
</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}f(3)&amp;=8 \\\\f(4)&amp;=16 \\\\f(5)&amp;=32 \\\\ f(6)&amp;=64 \\\\ f(7)&amp;=128 \end{align}\]</span></p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/well.jpg">
</p>
<p>This is when we cannot use a constant to represent the “slope”: we need to use a function that gives us different “slope” (rate of change) at different point. Or rather, we shouldn’t even call it a “slope” anymore since the rate of change is not constant. We call it derivative.</p>
<p><small> If you are still trying to get your head around what it means by “the rate of change is not constant”, imagine a cat at rest starts to accelerate constantly at <span class="math inline">\(1m/s^2\)</span>. Three seconds later it would be moving at the speed of <span class="math inline">\(3m/s\)</span>. So far the rate of change in its speed is constant. But when the cat begins to slow down, the rate of change would no longer be constant. </small></p>
<h3 class="_index">
4. How to find the derivative of a function?
</h3>
<p>The rate of change at a certain point in the function can be visualized as a straight line across the point.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/nonlinear2.png">
</p>
<blockquote>
This is normally called the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent">tangent line at a certain point</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>Since a non-linear function doesn’t have a constant rate of change, it means that every point of the function needs a different straight line to represent the rate of change.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/nonlinear3.png">
</p>
<p>To find the derivative of a function is to find another function that will output a value at every point, which can be represented by a corresponding straight line.</p>
<blockquote>
The rate of change at point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is therefore sometimes also known as the derivative at point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.
</blockquote>
<p>To get the straight line that represents the derivative at a certain point, one way to do it is to first locate 2 different points on the graph and draw a line across them.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/draw_a_straight_line.png">
</p>
<blockquote>
Some people refer to this line as a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line">secant line</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>This line represents a value. It represents the rate of change if the 2 points belong to a linear function.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/belong.png">
</p>
<p>But now this function is not linear. So this line is not accurate at all if we try to use it to represent the rate of change at any one of the 2 points.</p>
<p>Apparently, the closer the 2 points are, the more accurate the line is in representing the rate of change at any one point.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/dot_closer.png">
</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/dot_closer2.png">
</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s start off with a line that cuts across 2 points (A and B), and shift the line accordingly as we shift B towards A along the graph. By the time B is at the same point as A, we would have a line that can accurately represent the rate of change at point A - we would have a line that represents the derivate of the function at point A.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/dot_closer.gif">
</p>
<p>By turning the process above into a function (denoted by <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span>), this function would be the derivative of the function of the graph (denoted by <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}slope &amp;=  \frac{y_B-y_A}{x_B-x_A}\\\\f'(x) &amp;= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Here we are denoting the coordinate of point B as <span class="math inline">\((x+h, f(x+h))\)</span>. And what we are doing is obtaining a value for the straight line (the “slope”/derivative) at point A as we shift point B to A by making <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> approach 0. So the coordinate becomes <span class="math inline">\((x+0, f(x+0))\)</span>, which is the coordinate for point A.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/dot_closer2.gif">
</p>
<blockquote>
This is the modern definition of derivative in terms of limit.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> <sub>[aka Lagrange’s notation]</sub>, here is another common notation for differentiation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dx}f(x)\]</span></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a>, a great German mathematician, came up with this notation in the 17th century when he was still alive. He came up with it by seeing <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> as an <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal">infinitesimal (infinitely small)</a> change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> [the input of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>]. And the single <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> at the numerator here is supposed to be merged with <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> to indicate an infinitesimal change in <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> [the output of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>]. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{dx} f(x)\)</span> is sometimes written as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> stands for the output of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is actually a more <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_non-standard_analysis">ancient</a> way of defining a derivative: a derivative tells you the rate of change of the output at an infinitesimal scale as the input changes. Therefore it is <span class="math inline">\(dy\)</span> [or <span class="math inline">\(d\ f(x)\)</span>] divided by <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> - an infinitesimal change in <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, divided by an infinitesimal change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. So we are defining derivative in terms of a fraction (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)</span>) here, instead of a limit.</p>
<p>We call this way of thinking about derivative <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_analysis">non-standard analysis</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s say we want to get the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>. The straightforward way to do it is to compute the limit.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}\frac{d}{dx} x^3 &amp;= \lim_{a\rightarrow 0}\frac{(x+a)^3-x^3}{(x+a)-x} \\&amp;= \lim_{a\rightarrow 0}\frac{a(3x^2+a(3x+a))}{a} \\&amp;= \lim_{a\rightarrow 0} 3\cdot x^2+a(3x+a) \\&amp;=3\cdot x^2+0(3x+0) \\&amp;=3 \cdot x^2\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>But we can speed up the process by using shortcuts like this.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}\frac{d}{dx} x^n &amp; = n(x^{n-1}) \\ \frac{d}{dx} x^3 &amp;= 3(x^{3-1}) = 3 \cdot x^2 \end{align}\]</span></p>

5. Introducing anti-differentiation
</h3>
<p class="_index">
I shall now introduce a new concept called <u>anti-differentiation</u>. It is just the inverse of differentiation. It can be seen as a machine that takes in a function, <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>, and give you back another function, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, whose derivative is <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>. Here, <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> is known as the <u>anti-derivative</u> of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>.
</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/a_machine.png">
</p>
<p>Apparently, we will get the same derivative when differentiating functions that are only different at the part where it adds (or subtracts) a constant.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}\frac{d}{dx} x^2+100 &amp;= 2x \\ \frac{d}{dx} x^2+49 &amp;= 2x \\ \frac{d}{dx} x^2 &amp;= 2x \end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>As shown above, we can see that no matter what the constant is, it would always give us back the same function if we differentiate it. So, in order to be technically correct, we would need to put a placeholder, <span class="math inline">\(+ C\)</span>, in the end of the function to indicate that the anti-derivative can be any function that plus some constant (or minus some constant for cases when <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is negative).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}f(x) &amp;= 2x \\ \frac{d}{dx} g(x) &amp;= f(x) \\ g(x) &amp;= x^2 + C \end{align}\]</span></p>

6. What is integration?

<p>Integration is a fanciful name for the process of finding <u>integral</u>. Integral here is referring to either <u>indefinite integral</u>, or <u>definite integral</u>. (Therefore sometimes we say indefinite integration or definite integration just to be specific.)</p>
<p><u>Indefinite integral</u> is fundamentally equivalent to anti-derivative. They are basically the same thing.</p>

This is shown in the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"> first fundamental theorem of calculus</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> in the equation indicates that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the input we are integrating <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> with respect to. A function can take in more than one input [e.g. <span class="math inline">\(f(x,q) = x^2+q^3\)</span>] so there are times when it is crucial to specify which input we are integrating the function with respect to [e.g. Is it <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>? Integrating the function with respect to a different input would give us a different result].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Definite integral</u> can be defined as the difference between 2 identical anti-derivatives that take in different inputs.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int_a^b g(x)\ dx = f(b)-f(a) \]</span></p>
<p>This is often read as “the definite integral of g(x) from a to b”.</p>
<blockquote>
This definition of definite integral is derived from the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"> second fundamental theorem of calculus</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> here is sometimes referred to as the lower limit, while <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is referred to as the upper limit.
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another way to define what a definite integral is. Imagine you want to find out the area of the region under a curve in a graph.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/rs_fn.png">
</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/rs_area.png">
</p>
<p>You can approximate the area of the region by drawing rectangles under the curve and adding the area of these rectangles together. The smaller the width of the rectangle is, the more rectangle there would be, and the more accurate the approximation would be.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/rs1.png">
</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/rs2.png">
</p>
<p>This can actually be written into a summation. Here <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of rectangles.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(\frac{b-a}{n})\cdot g(a+ \frac{b-a}{n}i)\]</span></p>

This is known as the <a target="_blank" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RiemannSum.html">Riemann sum</a>. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{b-a}{n}\)</span> is the width of each rectangle, and <span class="math inline">\(g(a+ \frac{b-a}{n}i)\)</span> is the height.
</blockquote>
<p>We would be able to find the actual value for the area if we get the limit as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the number of rectangle, goes to <u>infinity</u>. Infinity here can be imagined as a theoretically enormous number that is bigger than every real number on the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line">number line</a>. This limit is another way of defining <u>definite integral</u>.</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img src="../img/from-chapter-1/ri.gif">

<p><span class="math display">\[\int_a^b g(x)\ dx = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(\frac{b-a}{n})\cdot g(a+ \frac{b-a}{n}i)\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Integral defined in this way is often known as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral">Riemann integral</a>. When the limit exists, we say the function is Riemann-integrable. When a function is not Riemann-integrable, it doesn’t mean it is completely not integrable. It really just depends on how we define “integral”. In a branch of maths known as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis">real analysis</a>, integration is normally defined <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integration">in the Lebesgue’s way</a>, different from the Riemann’s way above.

<p>In the limit above, we are getting the area of region underneath the graph of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.

Therefore we are actually getting the difference between <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(b)\)</span>. This is why definite integral of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> is able to give us the area from point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in the graph of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>: definite integral is giving us the overall change in value from <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f(b)\)</span>.</p>

7. How to find the definite integral of a function from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>?
</h3>
<p>Computing the limit of a Riemann sum can really be a tedious thing to do. So what we normally do is to find the indefinite integral first before putting <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> into the indefinite integral and getting the difference between them (using the definition of definite integral from the 2nd fundamental theorem of calculus mentioned above).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g(x) = x^4 \\ \int g(x)\ dx =\frac{x^5}{5} + C \\ \int_2^3 g(x)\ dx = \frac{3^5}{5}-\frac{2^5}{5} = 42.2 \]</span></p>
<p>Of course, it is <a target="_blank" href="http://math.stackexchange.com/q/710175/65082">not always necessary to get the indefinite integral first (it is possible to arrive at an answer after some transformations of the definite integral)</a>.</p>

<h3 class="_index">
8. How to find the indefinite integral (anti-derivative) of a function?
</h3>
<p>Apparently, we can reverse the differentiation shortcuts/rules above and turn them into integration shortcuts/rules. But sometimes a little bit of creativity is required for integration. Let’s take a look at the reverse-<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule">chain-rule</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ f'(g(x))g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} f(g(x))\]</span></p>
<p>Things don’t always come in a perfect bundle. To use reverse-chain-rule, most of the time we need to see the algebraic structure as <span class="math inline">\(f'(g(x))\)</span> and compute <span class="math inline">\(g'(x)\)</span> on our own.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f'(g(x)) = \frac{1}{g'(x)} \cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(g(x))\]</span></p>
<p>Here is an example. Let’s say we need to solve this indefinite integral.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx\]</span></p>
<p>We can see <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{x^2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(2x+1\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx = \int f'(g(x)) dx\]</span></p>
<p>What we need to do now is to obtain <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> by integrating <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span>, and obtain <span class="math inline">\(g'(x)\)</span> by differentiating <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x) = \int f'(x)\ dx = \int \frac{3}{x^2} \ dx= \frac{-3}{x}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} g(x) = \frac{d}{dx} 2x+1 = 2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}\int \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx&amp;= \frac{1}{g'(x)} \cdot f'(g(x)) \\&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{-3}{2x+1} + C \end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>So if we need to solve the definite integral <span class="math inline">\(\int_0^1 \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx\)</span>, we just put the two values into the indefinite integral and get the difference like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}\int_a^b \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2}\ dx &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot ( \frac{-3}{2 \cdot b +2} - \frac{-3}{2 \cdot a +2}) \\\\ \int_0^1 \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2}\ dx &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot (\frac{-3}{2 \cdot 1 +2} - \frac{-3}{2 \cdot 0 +2}) \\&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 1 \end{align}\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
This technique (reversing chain rule) is known as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution">integration by substitution</a>, or, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>-substitution, where <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> is often written as <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The truth is: finding an indefinite integral can be really hard sometimes. Aside from the fact that there isn’t an “absolute” way of humanly doing it, there is actually a rigorous mathematical reason behind it. The set of functions we humans love to do differentiation on is normally closed under differentiation. This means if we differentiate a function, we should anticipate to get back a similar function (e.g. differentiating an <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function">elementary function</a> gives us back an elementary function). But it is not the case for integration. It is possible to integrate an elementary function, and get a non-elementary function in return (e.g <span class="math inline">\(\int e^{x^2} dx\)</span> ). And as we can see, definite integration is more of a local operation, while indefinite integration is a global operation. This is why sometimes it makes more sense to solve a definite integral using transformations and techniques, arriving at the answer without having to compute the indefinite integral. There are respected individuals (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="http://math.stackexchange.com/users/19661/vladimir-reshetnikov">Vladimir Reshetnikov</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://math.stackexchange.com/users/97378/cleo">Cleo</a> on Maths StackExchange) who are amazingly good at it.</p>

9. Bonus: Partial derivative
</h3>
<p>When a function has more than one input value, we call it a multivariable function.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x_1,x_2) = 3x_1+x_2\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The graphs of functions that take in 1 input are lines in a 2D plane, while the graphs of functions that take in 2 inputs are surfaces in a 3D space, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To differentiate functions like this, we find the derivative with respect to one of the variables (denoted by <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> in this case). This type of derivative is known as a partial derivative.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n)\]</span></p>
<p>Finding a partial derivative is very similar to finding a normal derivative: we get the limit as x approaches 0. But instead of having just <span class="math inline">\(f(x+a)-f(x)\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(f(x_1,x_2..x_i+a..x_n)-f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n)\)</span>, since the function takes in more than one input.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}&amp;\ \ \ \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n) \\ &amp;= \lim_{a\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x_1,x_2..x_i+a..x_n)-f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n)}{(x_i+a)-x_i}\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>To do a partial differentiation, we simply pretend that other variables in the function are constants as we differentiate the function with respect to the chosen input. Here is an example.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}f(x,a,b,c) &amp;= x^5+2ax+10b^{9}+log_{a}(c) \\\\ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,a,b,c) &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^5+2ax+10C^{9}+log_{C}(C)) \\ &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^5+2Cx+C) \\ &amp;= 5x^4+2C \\ &amp;= 5x^4+2a  \end{align}\]</span></p>
<p><small>added on 29th Oct, at 5PM (SG Timezone, +8): [edited a couple of times around 8 30PM to express the idea of tangent space in a more clear and concise way. And corrected some mistakes I made in the analogy of tangent plane.] </small> Upon differentiating the function, we need to replace the remaining <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> back with the corresponding variables.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align} g(x,a,b,c) &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,a,b,c)  \\ &amp;= 5x^4+2C = 5x^4+2a \end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Basically, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,a,b,c)\)</span> tells you about how an infinitesimal change in the input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> would affect the output <span class="math inline">\(f(x,a,b,c)\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> remains unchangeable. To get the numerical value for the derivative, it is sometimes necessary to put an actual value into these variables.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align} g(1,2,0,0) &amp;= 629 \\g(1,3,0,0) &amp;= 631 \end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The derivative of functions with 1 input at one point (<span class="math inline">\(x,f(x)\)</span>) can be represented by a <a target="_blank" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TangentLine.html">tangent lines</a> when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is specified. Meanwhile, the representation for the derivative of functions with 2 inputs at points(<span class="math inline">\(x_1,x_2,f(x_1,x_2)\)</span>) where <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> is specified is a plane (<a target="_blank" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TangentPlane.html">tangent plane</a>), for functions with 3 input it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"> 3D space</a> (3D <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space">tangent space</a>), etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In normal differentiation (single-input functions). To obtain a numerical value for the rate of change at a certain point is to obtain the slope of the tangent line at that point: there is only 1 slope because there is only one single line going across one single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)">point</a>, <span class="math inline">\((x,f(x))\)</span>. To do it we just need to specify <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is only dependent on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The graph of a two-variable function is a 2 dimensional surface in 3 dimensional space, so each point can be represented by <span class="math inline">\((x_1,x_2,f(x_1,x_2))\)</span>, where the value of <span class="math inline">\(f(x_1,x_2)\)</span> is dependent to both <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The derivative with respect to any one of the variable (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>) when the variable (this case, <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>) is specific is a value dependent to <span class="math inline">\(f(x_1,x_2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>. So it is no longer a tangent line across one point, but a tangent plane across infinitely many points whose <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = \text{the specific value}\)</span>. This is why, if we want to get an actual numerical value for the slope, we need to specify <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The same applies to tangent of higher dimensions.</p>
