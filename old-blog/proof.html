<p>The Newtonian view of gravity is still taught in school today even though we now know that it is actually not an accurate description of gravity, especially when describing objects moving at a velocity near the speed of light, or objects with an enormous amount of mass such as a supermassive black hole in the center of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar">quasar</a>. And the reason why physics teachers are still teaching pre-university students the Newtonian theory is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-dependent_realism">it isn’t wrong</a>. It’s just that it has its limitation and an alternative model should be used when necessary. In comparison, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity"> the geometric theory of gravitation by Einstein</a> is a much better view of gravity, but is considered too complex for the average mind of normal adolescents. Therefore, despite the fact that we can use it to calculate how space and time are distorted near a black hole and how that affects the direction in which light travels observed from a different frame of reference, you barely see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations">Einstein field equations</a> appear in a junior college student’s physics textbook. And interestingly, there are also times when Einstein’s theory will seem to break down; just like its predecessor, it has its own limitation too. And that is why to better understand the fabric of the cosmos we need more advanced theories like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory">quantum field theory</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory">M-theory</a>.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about today isn’t physics, but how two seemingly unrelated theories, that are capable of describing the same thing in different ways like the different theories of gravity, are interconnected. In <a href="http://0.0ar.ch/article/iq-questions"><i>Some Seemingly Complex IQ Questions, Their Solutions, and Techniques</i></a>, I pointed out that the pattern in the progressive matrices below <a href="http://0.0ar.ch/article/iq-questions">can be described by using either a principle-based theory or a transformation-based theory</a>. And the same answer can be derived from both theories.</p>
<div class="picture in">
<img style="height:450px; width:auto;" src="../img/old-blog/q39.png"><br><i>The answer is B. Click <a id="pop">here</a> to read the solution if you haven’t.</i>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
$("#pop").on("click",null,null, function(){
    $(".popp").fadeIn(500);
},1);
</script>
<div class="popp h" style="margin-bottom: 15px;
padding: 10px;
background-color: #f8edda!important;
font-size: 14px;
border-bottom: 1px dotted #DFC1C2;
border-top: 1px dotted #DFC1C2;">
<p>This question can be solved by viewing either that among the pictures there is a pattern built on the foundation that <b style="font-family:Times">each row and column has to obey certain principles</b>, or that each picture (except the first one) is <b style="font-family:Times">the result of certain transformations that are applied to the previous picture</b>. <br> The first theory I formulated that works is that <b style="font-family:Times">in each row/column the different sets of similarities in terms of the position of polygon those 3 pictures share with their corresponding neighboring pictures are of the same number</b>. (e.g. The first and second pictures have 4 similarities - they both contain two triangles in the 4th and 6th blocks, a cross in the 7th block and a circle in the 9th block - and 4 is the number of similarities the second and third pictures have.) <br><br> Therefore the answer is <b style="font-family:arial">B</b>, the only picture that <b style="font-family:Times">shares 1 similarity with its horizontal neighbor</b>, the 8th picture (which <b style="font-family:Times">also shares 1 similarity with the 7th picture</b>), and <b style="font-family:Times">1 similarity with its vertical neighbor</b>, the 6th picture (which <b style="font-family:Times">also shares 1 similarity with the 3rd picture</b>).<br />
<br><br> But I was not quite satisfied with this theory as it doesn’t really describe the pattern in great details and it allows more than one possible answer to exist (though among the choices the only possible answer is B). So I went on studying the pictures and managed to come up with a more elaborate theory that works. Every picture undergoes a set of transformations to turn into the next picture. <br><br></p>
When the next pictures are in the same row, the transformations consist of<br><br>
<ol>
<li>
<b style="font-family:Times">the transfiguration of shapes</b> that causes triangles in the original picture to become crosses, circles to become triangles and crosses to become circles
</li>
<li>
<b style="font-family:Times">the one-block-to-the-right-per-picture movement of all polygons</b> (and one will move to the next row upon reaching the edge, or back to the first block upon reaching the end).
</li>
</ol>
<p><br> And when the next pictures are not in the same row (e.g. from 3rd to 4th picture), there will be <b style="font-family:Times">a clockwise rotational transformation</b> instead. <br><br> Interestingly, this theory too suggests that <b style="font-family:arial">B</b> is the answer. And this is no coincidence. Using mathematics, we can actually prove that the pattern described in the first theory is the consequence of the transformations described in the second theory. Or in the language of propositional calculus, <b style="font-family:arial">transformations_in_2ndT ⇒ pattern_in_1stT</b>.</p>
</div>
And apparently we can prove <b style="font-family:arial">transformations_in_2ndT ⇒ pattern_in_1stT</b> mathematically. Now I shall present to you a humble proof of mine: <br><br>
<ol>
<li>
Let there be a function, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x+1\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;9\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 1\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x=9\)</span>, with the domain <span class="math inline">\([1, 9]\)</span>.
</li>
<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This function is used to model the one-block-to-the-right movement of all polygons. $f(original\_position) = position\_in\_the\_next\_picture$ &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;</code></pre>
<li>
Let there be three empty sets, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Randomly assign the integers 1 to 9 to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> each has a cardinality of 3 [this means each of them has 3 elements]. In another words, <span class="math inline">\(A⊖B⊖C = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}, |A|=|B|=|C|=3\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are used to model the positions of polygons in terms of their shapes. The elements in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> represent the positions of polygons in one shape (e.g. cross), while elements in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> represent the positions of polygons in other shapes.</p>
<div class="picture in">
<p><img style="width:400px;" src="../img/old-blog/i-am-too-kind.jpg"></p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
Let there be an algorithm <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that moves the original elements in set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In another words, <span class="math inline">\(A_2=C_1, B_2=A_1, C_2=B_2\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let the transfiguration of shapes be from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: we can now model it using the algorithm <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. And we can see that the transformation from one picture to another consists of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(\{A,B,C\})\)</span>.</p>
<div class="picture in">
<p><img style="width:400px;" src="../img/old-blog/i-am-just-too-kind.jpg"></p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
Now imagine that <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, an element in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, is also an element in <span class="math inline">\(f(A)\)</span>. <br>In another words, <span class="math inline">\(q ∈ f(A)∩B\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
The representation of polygons in shape B and their positions in the second picture can be derived by <span class="math inline">\(f(A)\)</span> and applying the algorithm <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Therefore we can see that if <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> exists, it is a symmetry (in terms of position and shape) of a polygon between pictures 1 and 2.
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
Let there be 2 sets, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(I = f(A) ∩ B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U = f(f(A)) ∩ f(B)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(f(z)=f(z)\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, it is true that <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> have the same cardinality.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
We have proved that the number of symmetries between pictures 1 and 2 is equivalent to the number of symmetries between pictures 2 and 3 when only polygons in shape B are concerned.
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
And therefore it is also true that <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> will both have the same cardinality <br>for <span class="math inline">\(I = (f(A) ∩ B) ∪ (f(B) ∩ C) ∪ (f(C) ∩ A)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U = (f(f(A)) ∩ f(B)) ∪ (f(f(B)) ∩ f(C)) ∪ (f(f(C)) ∩ f(A))\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
Voilà! We have now proved that in each row the different sets of similarities in terms of the position of polygon 3 pictures share with their corresponding neighbors are of the same number. But it doesn’t end here since we have yet to prove that the same principle also applies to each column.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
Now let <span class="math inline">\((z_{n})\)</span> be the sequence of 9 integers defined as <span class="math inline">\(z_{n} = n\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
This is used to model the positions of polygons in the first picture.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
Let there be a sequence transformation, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, that transforms a sequence <span class="math inline">\(( u_{n} )\)</span> into the sequence <span class="math inline">\(( w_{n} )\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(w_{1}=u_{9}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(w_n = u_{n}-1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;1\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
This is used to model the one-blocks-to-the-right movements each polygon experiences from the first to second picture, from the second to third picture, and from the fourth to sixth picture, etc.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
Let there be another sequence transformation, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, that transforms a sequence <span class="math inline">\(( u_{n} )\)</span> into the sequence <span class="math inline">\(( w_{n} )\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(w_{1} = u_{7}, w_{2} = u_{4}, w_{3} = u_{1}, w_4 = u_8\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w_5 = u_5, w_{6} = u_{2}, w_7 = u_9, w_8 =u_6, w_9 = u_3\)</span>
</li>
<div class="picture in">
<p><img style="width:400px;" src="../img/old-blog/i-just-am-too-kind.jpg"></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
This is used to model the rotation occurring from third to fourth picture, and sixth to seventh picture.
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
Let <span class="math inline">\(( m_{n} )\)</span> be a new sequence that is the result of <span class="math inline">\(( z_{n} )\)</span> after transformations <span class="math inline">\(D, D, L\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(( j_{n} )\)</span> be another new sequence that is the result of <span class="math inline">\(( m_{n} )\)</span> after transformations <span class="math inline">\(D, D, L\)</span>.
</li>
<div class="picture in">
<p><img style="width:400px;" src="../img/old-blog/too-kind.jpg"></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
The two sequences <span class="math inline">\(( m_{n} )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(( j_{n} )\)</span> are used to model the positions of polygons in the fourth and seventh picture in relative to the first picture.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
Now let <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> be a set of 9 order pairs: <span class="math inline">\({(z_1, m_1), (z_2, m_2), .... (z_9, m_9)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be another set of 9 order pairs: <span class="math inline">\({(m_1, j_1), (m_2, j_2), .... (m_9, j_9)}\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
Each set of order pairs is used to model the comparison between two pictures (in this case, pictures 1 and 4, and pictures 4, and 7).
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> since each order pair in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is equivalent to some order pair in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
Now we have proved that the symmetry between pictures 1 and 4 is equivalent to the symmetry between picture 4 and 7 when the transformation only consists of L and D. Since the transfiguration of shapes is also a part of the transformation, we have to prove that the symmetry still holds even when the transfiguration of shapes is applied.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
Now let there be a function <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x+1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = 1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x = 3\)</span> in the domain <span class="math inline">\([1,3]\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
This is used to model the change in shape (integers 1, 2 and 3 represent the 3 different shapes).
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
Let <span class="math inline">\(v(x)\)</span> be a function that outputs the corresponding value (either 1, 2, or 3) to represent the shape at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-th position in the first picture.
</li>
<br>

<li>
<p>Since the two integers in each and every order pair in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are only the representations of the positions but not of the shapes, we need <span class="math inline">\(v(x)\)</span> to bring in the numerical representations of shapes to put into <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>.</p>

</ul>
<br>
<li>
<p>Let there be an integer <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(z = (g ∘ g)(r)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is an integer that represents the shape of a polygon, <span class="math inline">\((g ∘ g)(z)\)</span> is therefore equivalent to <span class="math inline">\((g ∘ g ∘ g ∘ g)(r)\)</span>. And therefore it is also true that <span class="math inline">\((g ∘ g ∘ g ∘ g)(v(π_{l}(p))) = (g ∘ g)(v(π_{r}(p)))\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\((g ∘ g)(v(π_{l}(p))) = v(π_{r}(p))\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be any order pair in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<div class="picture in">
<p><img style="width:550px" src="../img/old-blog/being-so-kind.jpg"></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
Now let <span class="math inline">\(( z_{n} )\)</span> model the positions of polygons in the second picture. And let <span class="math inline">\(( m_{n} )\)</span> be a new sequence that is the result of <span class="math inline">\(( z_{n} )\)</span> after transformations <span class="math inline">\(D, L, D\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(( j_{n} )\)</span> be another new sequence that is the result of <span class="math inline">\(( m_{n} )\)</span> after transformations <span class="math inline">\(D, L, D\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
The two sequences <span class="math inline">\(( m_{n} )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(( j_{n} )\)</span> are now used to model the positions of polygons in the fifth and seventh picture in relative to the second picture.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
Using the same steps above, and this time let <span class="math inline">\(v(x)\)</span> be a function that outputs the corresponding value (either 1, 2, or 3) to represent the shape at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-th position in the second picture, we can prove that the symmetry holds as <span class="math inline">\((g ∘ g ∘ g ∘ g)(v(π_{l}(p))) = (g ∘ g)(v(π_{r}(p)))\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\((g ∘ g)(v(π_{l}(p))) = v(π_{r}(p))\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be any order pair in the new <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Now let <span class="math inline">\(( z_{n} )\)</span> model the positions of polygons in the third picture. And do the same thing this time with the transformations as <span class="math inline">\(L, D, D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v(x)\)</span> as a function that outputs the corresponding value to represent the shape at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-th position in the third picture.
</li>
<br>
<li>
We can see that the symmetry holds too since it is also true that <span class="math inline">\((g ∘ g ∘ g ∘ g)(v(π_{l}(p))) = (g ∘ g)(v(π_{r}(p)))\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\((g ∘ g)(v(π_{l}(p))) = v(π_{r}(p))\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be any order pair in the new <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.
</li>
<div class="picture in">
<p><img style="width:480px" src="../img/old-blog/theEnd.jpg"></p>

<li>
Therefore, transformations_in_2ndT ⇒ pattern_in_1stT.
