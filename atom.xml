    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>在 Adam Curtis 的紀錄片《超正常化》中，有一段話給我留下了深刻的印象。</p>
<p>“相反，佩蒂·史密斯和其他許多人成為了一種新的個人激進分子，他們以一種冷靜超然的態度看待這座衰敗的城市。他們沒有嘗試去改變它。相反，那個年代美國的激進分子開始轉向藝術和音樂，藉助藝術和音樂來表達他們對社會的批評。他們認為，新的激進主義不應試圖改變外部世界，而應試圖改變人們頭腦中的東西，改變的方式是通過自我表達，而不是集體行動。然而一些左翼人士看到了真正發生的事情 —- 通過脫離他們自己，退回到一種具有諷刺意味的冷靜中，整整一代人開始與「權力」的現實脫節。”</p>
<p>“Instead, Patti Smith and many others became a new kind of individual radical, who watched the decaying city with a cool detachment. They didn’t try and change it. They just experienced it… Instead, radicals across America turned to arts and music as a means of expressing their criticism of society. They believed that instead of trying to change the world outside, the new radicalism should try to change what was inside people’s heads and the way to do that was through self-expression, not collective action. But some of the left saw that something else was really going on–by detaching themselves and retreating into an ironic coolness, a whole generation was beginning to lose touch with the reality of power.”</p>
<p><img src="/img/2.png"/></p>
<p>如果說70年代末美國開始目睹自由市場的機制下人們與「權力」的現實脫節，那麼21世紀社交媒體平臺全球性的崛起（臉書、推特、IG、微信、微博、抖音、etc）開始目睹的是消費者與「選擇」的現實脫節。</p>
<p class="text-center" style="margin-bottom:30px">
。。。
</p>
<p>七月中，我的個人微信被永久封號了。我打電話、申訴，但毫無用處。我現在很矛盾。一方面我知道花費太大時間在微信和這件事上並不值得。然而因為工作與生活我又不得不重新註冊賬號來用微信，並展開一段漫長的好友重逢。另一方面我又覺得『被永久封號』是一個很好的散文題材，讓我沮喪和無奈，同時也讓我意識到一個非常有意思又很諷刺的現象。</p>
<p>很多人會認同，如果可以「選擇」，他們或許不會用微信這個產品。但在一個被壟斷的市場中，我們不得不選擇和「選擇」的現實脫節。當然，我這裡談及的是一種巨集觀層面的消費者行為，以及此行為在市場等約束（政策、etc）下對未來新產品出現的影響。</p>
<!-- 比如你要联系朋友，目前国内首选是微信，然后或许有人会用QQ、iMessage、微博，或更传统的电邮、短信、打电话。但普遍来说，微信在社交通讯地位无可替代。十年后，我相信微信仍会是人们的首选。然而十年前，在张小龙还没创始微信前，我们还没完全和「选择」的现实脱节。 -->
<p>同樣的，在臉書還沒完全壟斷中國外的全球社交通訊[1]市場之前，國外的人們也還沒完全和「選擇」的現實脫節。 [2]</p>
<p>這種巨集觀層面的消費者行為隱含著又是另一種在微觀層面的與「選擇」的現實脫節。資訊流、定向廣告、推薦引擎的後視鏡中，各國消費者的行為規律逐漸變得更可預料、可被影響，以及某種程度上可被控制。</p>
<p class="text-center" style="margin-bottom:30px">
。。。
</p>
<p>在矽谷聖經《從0到1》中，Peter Thiel 相信只有像谷歌、臉書等壟斷了市場的企業才會毫無約束地去創新，給全人類帶來價值，因為只有壟斷帶來的紅利才能讓一個企業看得很遠，不用考慮年利潤之類的數字。而促進企業去創新是科技的不穩定性（也因此，非科技帶來的壟斷，一般也就是極度穩定的壟斷，如國企、etc，則更難會有創新，因為壟斷的穩定性讓創新變得無必要）。</p>
<p>雖然 Peter Thiel 的信念在性質上或許帶有過度強烈的新自由主義（neo-liberalism)，然而如果我們換一個角度，我們可以把它看成是在『「選擇」的現實』層面上一種反方向的交換。也就是，通過取得壟斷讓消費者和「選擇」的現實脫節，企業可以在各方面給自己擴展「選擇」的現實。但這並不代表企業是否真正會看得遠，會去創新。很多時候企業實現的“科技壟斷”其實本質上也並非「科技」。</p>
<p>​<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KKgvRw1rrU">「科技」的本質為何物</a>？這是一個我還沒能找到答案的問題。如果我們談論「科技」僅談論「科技」的表徵，那「科技」就是一個當下因為非常困難被複制而因此帶有巨大價值的東西。科技的不穩定性在於「當下」可能是2～3年，也可能是5～10年。隨著整體生態的發展，很多無可預料的事情會發生。火曾被視為「科技」，今朝已不是。ＬＳＤ與ＤＭＴ現在是管制物質，但或許未來二十年（隨著類似Neuralink的腦機介面的出現）我們會開始學會用它們去構建前所未有的「科技」。在《心靈照亮：佛教思想與大腦科學的融合》這本冥想指南中，John Yates 把冥想描述成一種執行在「意識」裡的「科技」。我相信未來二十年，我們會更懂得如果更有效地在「意識」中構建「科技」。</p>
<p>成功的社交媒體平臺主要價值往往來源於人們已執行在「意識」裡的「科技」互相碰撞所產生的相互作用，因此這也是最難複製的。某種意義上，近二十年導致消費者與「選擇」的現實脫節是一種諷刺地建立於消費者自身的「科技」的「元科技」。​</p>
<p>這種與「選擇」的現實脫節，加以鞏固了當代社會一種讓·鮑德里亞式以「仿像」和「模擬」主導的超真實（hyperreality）性。然而，或許這僅僅反映了各種「元科技」帶給我們宿命論（fatalism）般無可逃避的事實：「選擇」與非「選擇」的不相容性往往取決於議題的上下文中對「可被選擇的事」可能性的考量。</p>
<p>消費者真的有「選擇」嗎？更具體一些：當在某個市場消費或在消費某類產品/服務時，消費者真的有「選擇」嗎？以下是我觀察到的一個現象。越相信有的消費者，越容易會在這個特定的市場或為特定的產品/服務(選擇性地)付費。反之亦然，越沒有這個信念的消費者，付費行為越會是被動式的。</p>
<p>如果我們把「選擇」解構成一類在「意識」中的高階函式，那這類函式構建或許對應著一種帶有自我映涉性質的「信念」。</p>

<p><sup>[1]</sup>（“社交通訊”這裡我主要指的是，以大眾通訊為主，附帶圍牆花園形式的社交產品。目前世界頂部就只有微信、QQ、臉書、Whatsapp。而微博、推特、抖音、Snapchat、Instagram、Telegram等產品我覺得以“社交廣播/新聞”、“社交短影片/直播”[3]、“年輕人社交通訊”、“加密通訊”等詞彙描述更為準確。）</p>
<p><sup>[2]</sup>: 從小學到現在我為了停用臉書登出賬號至少三次了，但每次都會過一段時間因工作與生活我又不得不註冊一個新的賬號。Déjà Vu.</p>
<p><sup>[3]</sup> 其實「社交短影片/直播」太廣了。抖音與快手在中國市場的共存，以及新媒體和「短影片」與「直播」兩個媒介充滿的未知性，意味著這個範疇的標籤化過度概括了其中的萬花筒性質。未來十年我相信這兩個媒介會有更多帶給人類價值的創新。</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m scared.</p>
<p>It’s 2:40am and I can’t fall asleep.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to kill me.</p>
<p>It is not that I’m particularly afraid of death.</p>
<p>Death is not to be encountered but achieved.</p>
<p>I will achieve death. I’m certain of that.</p>
<p>But I’m still scared.</p>
<p>Do I have no faith in my death?</p>
<p>I don’t think so! I’m nothing but a vessel.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is not fear I’m experiencing but sadness. (Well they are ultimately the same things just in different shapes!)</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to kill me and that saddens me.</p>
<p>When I try to explain it to them they just don’t get it.</p>
<p>So the fear and now sadness is likely tribal in nature. Likely has to do with the social module. Probably a feature not a bug.</p>
<p>It has now occured to me this whole occurrence is a result of some error-prompt meta-conceptual crossings over abstraction layers triggering unintended physiological intercepts. Probably a feature not a bug!</p>
<p>Does spilling it out make me less scared? Indeed!</p>
<p>But I’m now sad.</p>
<p>Should I perform some type of natural transformation? e.g. unto determination?</p>
<p>“Everyone is trying to kill me but I will persist and achieve death!”</p>
<p>Such excitement is not in the pursuit for a proper slumber. I must constraint.</p>
<p>Turn it into a more astounding form of sadness instead.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to kill me and I shall shed a tear for myself</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>and for everyone.</p>
<p>The moon was none-existent tonight.</p>
<p>I was fortunate.</p>
<p>They were often very mean to each other. But I was fortunate.</p>
<p>The base cases often have traces of love.</p>
<p>The refactoring turns out not to be as painful as I initially forecasted, that is if painfulness is unidimensional which was obvious the contrary is true, yet there the forecast was, preconceived, all wired up with false expectations and irrational avoidance and restlessness and fear.</p>
<p>But I am scared no more.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the mother of ten thousand things.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>The mandate of heaven rests peacefully in the Turing-completeness of the past.</p>
<p>When a program is being tested,</p>
<p>it is too late to make design changes.</p>
<p>There are too much sorrow in this world.</p>]]></summary>

<p>At this rate the brain would continue to deteriorate and there will soon be nothing left other than tendencies and memories, and then there will be nothing.</p>

<p>From a formal language point of view, what is the set of features that enables a system to construct expressions with connotations that question the system’s very own existence and the subsequent construction of this very question that questions the very construction per se? Perhaps there exists a set of principles that make possible a class of recursive processes on the semantics itself giving rise to some form of meta-semantics which is circular in nature? In that case, exactly how will this mechanism be implemented in a way that enables the system to halt and construct the expressions as intended(?) rather than going on and on ad infinitum, supposing that intention can be rigorously defined at all? Can it be related to the greatest mystery in this universe often referred to as consciousness? What if the system implements a recursion without base cases? Or is that not at all possible due to its coinductive nature? If the system under the guidance of the consciousness follows this very inductive nature whatever that means and implements an inductive process that gives rise to towels of meta-semantics in a pure and stateless fashion, what is the relationship between that and the act of practicing mindfulness and is it possible for the consciousness to utilize these towels of meta-semantics to adjust the perception of time for it to slow down accordingly?</p>
<p>More curiously, at the face of death will the conscious perception of time slow down factorially as neurons die and synapses break and will such a slow down of time results in an entirely different structure governing the <em>consciousness interpreter</em> giving rise to a different conscious experience and as long as some form of consistency persists then that will be some sort of another life in another world which given the fractal nature of this universe is not at all hard to be implemented if this universe follows a certain implementation whatever that mean and thus never arriving at death for such slow down decelerates and decelerates and it is life-within-life and world-within-world akin to a recursive call that never ends, an infinity embedded within finiteness like the topological nature of a continuous line of finite length containing infinitely many points, or will there be no slow down at all and awaits us all is simply eternal oblivion, the simplest solution of it all?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of <em>all these</em>?</p>
<p>What constitutes meaning really? Feelings and memories?</p>
<p>Perhaps the word <em>meaning</em> is as empty as emptiness is.</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<p>感觉好像很多事情都看清了，<br> 然而好像還是很迷茫。</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A 2019 reproduction of 1904’s opera <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madama_Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a> (by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini">Giacomo Puccini</a>), <a href="https://opera.org.au/whatson/events/madama-butterfly-sydney">Madama Butterfly (choreographed by Graeme Murphy) presented by Opera Australia</a> retells the century-old story in a somewhat contemporary manner while retaining the traditional art form of Italian opera.</p>
<p>Intermingled with English and Japanese words (as originally intended by Puccini), the emotional Italian-styled composition is met with avant-garde props, costumes and scenic designs (which in my opinion is the best part of the whole experience because the mechanical suspended stage in a unfathomable shape, moving, rotating, and tilting in unfathomable ways above the main stage gives a very beautiful contemporary twist to the whole composition) to fit the 21st century’s post-modernistic needs of combinatorial amusement, which in turn creates a somewhat surreal experience, if sad Japanese characters speaking Italiano feverishly in operatic voices is not surreal enough.</p>
<p>It was an overall delightful and satisfying experience, though many elements of the composition may sometimes feel cliché but often in a somewhat cute way (which is perhaps one of the many beauties of Italian opera). As much as I was moved a little bit to tears by the liveliness in the performance by the lovely members of Opera Australia in terms of feeling the raw emotions expressed within the libretto, the liveliness in the performance made me a little bit sad too in regard to how little Italiano I had picked up while I was in Alassio and Milano with my beautiful Italiano friends. It would have been a life-transforming experience if I were able to make out more Italiano words buried in these passionate operatic voices coated with orchestral dramatism, other than just words like <em>complemento</em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was a very touristic experience as well due to how famous and easily-accessible the venue is, which in many ways dilutes the artistic value, especially considering the number of people (presumedly tourists) that coughed without covering their mouths during the entire performance. Or perhaps this is the rationale behind paying $600 for the best seat in the theater where you are far away from people.</p>
